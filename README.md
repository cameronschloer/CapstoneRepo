# Team 14 Softech Code Repository


#Overview
The CapstoneRepo holds all the necessary code for running all the hardware we have created
for the capstone project. It is a combination of original work we have created and also
open source code. This document explains how to initialize and run everything.

Before getting started with the code, you will need to configure your computer operating
system and download some necessary software.

1. We found that ROS, the open-source robot operating system software, is easiest to use
on a computer using a linux based operating system. We used Ubuntu 18.04 To read more about
ROS, you can learn about it [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Introduction)

2. Following the instructions on the [ROS Tutorials Website](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials),
Follow steps 1 and 2 to download and get familiar with using ROS. The distribution
of ROS used for this project is called Melodic. Do not download kinetic.

Once you have finished, clone the Capstone Repo to your catkin folder using

#Running the Ros software

1. Open a terminal and begin Ros by typing ```roscore

```
